# MiniChess

A simple chess program written by C#. You can play with your friend locally, or use it to gennerate a endgame to practice.

## Usage

- Move: Generally when you click a piece you get its highlighted place that it's allowed to move to; And to move, just click the place you want.White goes first, and then black does.
- Promotion: Scroll mouse wheel on the place where you've promoted to choose the piece you want.
- Rotation: Scroll mouse wheel on the center of the board to rotate the whole board.
- Edit: hit SPACE 5 times and you'll get the ability to remove/add a piece by using mouse middle click.Once you create a piece(should be a Pawn), you can scroll mouse wheel on it right away to change to another piece.You can even have two kings or more!

Enjoy!
